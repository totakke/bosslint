## Installation

### Mac OS

```console
$ curl -sSL https://github.com/totakke/bosslint/releases/download/0.2.1/bosslint_macos -o bosslint
$ chmod +x bosslint
$ mv bosslint [/your/PATH/dir/]
```

### Linux

$ curl -sSL https://github.com/totakke/bosslint/releases/download/0.2.1/bosslint_linux -o bosslint
$ chmod +x bosslint
$ mv bosslint [/your/PATH/dir/]
```

### Build

You must setup GraalVM's `native-image` and set `GRAALVM_HOME` environment
variable.

```console
$ clojure -M:native-image
$ mv bosslint [/your/PATH/dir/]
```

## Usage

Bosslint collects changed files under Git version control and checks them with
appropriate linters.

```console
$ bosslint check HEAD~1
clj-kondo:
linting took 281ms, errors: 0, warnings: 0

cljfmt:
All source files formatted correctly

eastwood:
...
== Linting done in 1887 ms ==
== Warnings: 0 (not including reflection warnings)  Exceptions thrown: 0
```

Use `:all` to check all files under a Git project.

```console
$ bosslint check :all
```

### Configuration

Bosslint implicitly loads `~/.bosslint/config.edn` file.

Alternatively, you can specify a configuration file with `--config` option.

```console
$ bosslint check --config [/path/to/config.edn] master
```

Look at the [configuration example](example/config.edn).
